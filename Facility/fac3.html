Physical Education & Sports

St. Xavier’s College is dedicated in its effort to promote Physical Education and Sports. Through its sports facilities,
able Sports Director, support staff, students and their performance, the college displays its seriousness towards sports
and physical fitness.

Research supports the importance of movement in educating both mind and body. Physical education and sports contribute 
directly to development of physical competence and fitness. It also helps students to make informed choices and understand 
the value of leading a physically active lifestyle. A healthy and physically active student is more likely to be academically
